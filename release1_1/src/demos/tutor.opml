Probably the best way to think of a statement is as a paragraph.  All of the paragraphs you have read so far were individual statements, and the headings (as at the top of the screen) are also short statements.  It is sometimes hard to tell where one paragraph ends and the next one begins.  In AUGMENT, there is a way to change your view of a file (but not alter the file at all).  What you do is change the &quot;viewspecs&quot;."/>
