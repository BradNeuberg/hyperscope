Now that you know a little more about the way files are structured in AUGMENT, we will take advantage of that knowledge in this new file.  It is actually a structured file, and by turning on appropriate viewspecs, you can get a view of the table of contents of the file without having to read through the whole file.  By now, you have enough basic editing skills to do most things, but you may be interested in learning more about a few specific topics.  When you finish reading this paragraph, you should take a look at the contents of the file with a one-line, one-level view to see what is coming.  Here's another shortcut:  Very often you will want to see one line and one level or all lines and all levels.  Viewspec &quot;x&quot; is one line, one level (like setting viewspecs d and t together), and viewspec &quot;w&quot; is all lines, all levels (like setting viewspecs c and s together).  Turn on viewspec &quot;x&quot; (using the command &quot;Set Viewspecs x&lt;OK&gt;&quot;) to view the main headings, and then turn on viewspec &quot;w&quot; and continue."/>

The files TUTOR, TUTOR2, and TUTOR3 do not come anywhere near covering all of the features of AUGMENT.  In a sense, they just begin to scratch the surface.  Some more advanced topics can be found in the file &lt;TUTOR, TUTOR4,&gt; which is similar to the first three, but covers topics which may not be of interest to everyone.  When you have finished reading this file, you may jump to that file and read it, or you may copy it into your own directory if you wish to edit it."/>

For example, suppose you are reading a file, and you come to a heading in which you have no interest.  Presumably, if your file is well structured, all the statements at levels below (down from) the heading have to do with the heading, so you would like to skip them too, and get to the next main heading.  If your statement numbers are on, you can tell by the number of the heading what the number of the next statement at the same level as the heading will be.  For example, suppose that the heading has statement number 3c.  What will the statement number of the next heading be?  The answer is: 3d (if there is a next heading at that level).  If there are no more statements at that level, the next information that might be of interest would be under statement 4."/>

Similarly, Back can move you one statement back in the file, which can be very useful if you have jumped one statement too far.  Next is only useful when you can see that a statement has ended at the bottom of your screen, which it is often difficult to tell.  You are usually safer to jump to MARK and mark the bottom statement on the screen.  This reshows some of the bottom statement on the top of the screen, but it assures you that you did not miss reading any text."/>

Every time you jump in a file, AUGMENT records exactly where you were, together with the viewspecs that were in effect at the time.  A list of ten previous views is kept, and it is possible to return to any of these views.  Thus, you can be momentarily distracted and Jump off somewhere without noting where you were, and return back to your previous position.  The command to do this is Jump (to) Return &lt;OK&gt;.  After you type this, you will be presented with a &quot;flashback&quot; of the first few characters from the top of your previous views, to which you answer &quot;y&quot; (or &lt;OK&gt;) for &quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;n&quot; for &quot;no&quot;.  As soon as you answer &quot;yes&quot;, you will be returned to that view.  Don't worry about missing the one you want -- if you accidentally type &quot;n&quot; to it, the views will cycle around and give you a second chance.  Try using the Jump (to) Return command now to see how it works."/>

A possible way to think of it is as if you put a clear plastic transparency over the real file, and marked your corrections on it.

Can you think of why?  The reason is that in some sense, the statement EFGH &quot;belongs&quot; to statement ABCD, not to IJKL.  If ABCD were a chapter title, EFGH would be the contents of that chapter.  Inserting a new chapter title should not move the contents of the other chapter to be within it.  When you tell the machine that the new statement is to follow an old chapter head, and to be at the same level, it assumes that it, too, will be a chapter title.  It is therefore put where the next chapter title belongs.  You can, however, move the EFGH to follow the IJKL, using the level adjustment to do it.  Go back to the example, and try that."/>

This command does not alter the information inside the file at all, and sometimes this is a little surprising.  For example, if you copy the file named &quot;tutor,tutor4,&quot; to a new file named &quot;tutor4,&quot; in your own directory, and then jump to that file, you will note that the origin statement still identifies that file as being in the TUTOR directory.

A SID can be used as the target of a Jump command, as in &quot;Jump (to) Link 043&lt;OK&gt;&quot;, but it can also be used for editing purposes.  Try inserting a new statement below this one with the SIDs on, and then delete it by typing its SID when you are given the &quot;M/A:&quot; prompt in the Delete Statement command."/>

Simply find the SID of the statement to be moved, and jump to the place you want to move it to.  Suppose that the SID of the statement you want to move is 089.  To move it to follow a statement on your screen, use the command &quot;Move Statement (from) 089&lt;OK&gt; (to follow) MARK&lt;OK&gt;&quot;.  Alternatively, you can find the SID of the statement you want the new statement to follow (suppose it is 0183), and jump to the statement to be moved.  The command would then be &quot;Move Statement (from) MARK (to follow) 0183&lt;OK&gt;&lt;OK&gt;&quot;.  (For real experts, there is no need to have either of the statements on the screen for the move -- simply give the SIDs of both)."/>

This pair of viewspecs controls whether the numbering (which may be either SIDs or statement numbers) is displayed at the beginning or the end of the statement.  If viewspec &quot;n&quot; (numbers off) is in force, the G/H setting makes no difference, just like the I/J pair.

All possible combinations of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; are possible.
