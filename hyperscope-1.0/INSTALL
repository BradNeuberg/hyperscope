HyperScope Installation
=======================

To use HyperScope with your OPML documents, you must do two things.
You must install the HyperScope code in your web directory, and you
must insert one line into your OPML document.

The hyperscope directory (this directory) must be in your root web
directory.  The easiest way to do this is to copy this directory into
your root web directory.  If you would like to put the source files
elsewhere, and if you are running the Apache web server, you can add
the mod_rewrite rule in hyperscope/etc/httpd.conf to your server
configuration.

The second line of your OPML documents should be an xml-stylesheet
processing instruction that looks like:

<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="/hyperscope/src/client/lib/hs/xslt/hyperscope.xsl"?>

For examples, see the OPML documents in hyperscope/src/demos.
