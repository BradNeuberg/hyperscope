HyperScope v1.0
===============

The HyperScope is a high-performance thought processor that enables
you to navigate, view, and link to documents in sophisticated
ways. It's the brainchild of Doug Engelbart, the inventor of hypertext
and the mouse, and is the first step towards his larger vision for an
Open Hyperdocument System.

The HyperScope is written in JavaScript using the Dojo toolkit and
works in Firefox (recommended) and Internet Explorer. It uses OPML as
its base file format. It is open source and available under the GPL.
(See LICENSE for more information.)
