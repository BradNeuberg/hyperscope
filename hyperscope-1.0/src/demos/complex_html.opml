It is called a mouse.  Without pushing any buttons, roll the mouse around on the surface of your worktable, and watch the screen.  Notice that there is a cursor, or underline character, which moves as you roll the mouse.  When you roll the mouse right and left, the cursor moves right and left; as you roll the mouse toward and away from you, the cursor moves down and up.  Later, when a command requires you to point to something, you will do so by moving the mouse until the cursor is under the character you want to point to, and then pressing the OK key."/>
