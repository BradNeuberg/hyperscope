Files are hierarchically structured, and textual address expressions can flexibly specify any text entity in any file.  The screen may be divided into arbitrary, rectangular windows, allowing cross-file editing between windows.  Many options exist for controlling the &quot;view&quot; of a file's text in a window, e.g.: level clipping, paragraph truncation, and content filtering.  Structural study and modification of on-line documents are especially facilitated.  A Journal system and &quot;Shared Screen Teleconferencing&quot; support collaboration among authors and their colleagues.  Graphic illustrations may be embedded in the same file with text. "/>
