Remember that, in general, the backspace key will undo exactly one keystroke (whether a command word, a mark, or a character you type).  The &quot;CMD DELETE&quot; key can be used to cancel an entire command, so that you can start over again.  As a shortcut, the left mouse button is a backspace, and the middle button is the same as the command delete key."/>

Then perform a few experiments of the following type:  Do either Jump (to) MARK or Jump (to) Origin, but instead of immediately giving the final &lt;OK&gt; when the &quot;V:&quot; prompt appears, type one or more viewspecs, and note that your view will change when the jump is completed.  So far the only viewspecs we know about are &quot;y&quot; (blank lines on), &quot;z&quot; (blank lines off), &quot;m&quot; (numbers on), and &quot;n&quot; (numbers off).  There are many other viewspecs, and you are welcome to fool around with them, but remember the Reset Viewspecs command, and the Jump (to) Link command to get back here.  (For the truly adventuresome, there is a way to specify viewspecs in a Jump (to) Link command.  After you type the number of the statement to which you wish to jump, follow it with a colon and then the desired viewspecs before typing &lt;OK&gt;.  For example, to get to statement 3 with numbers on and blank lines between statements, type &quot;jl3:my&lt;OK&gt;&quot;.)"/>

You may, if you wish, follow the comma with a statement number, and you will be taken to that statement number in that file.  To get to statement number 5 in the TUTOR file, for example, type &quot;jl&quot; (for Jump (to) Link), followed by &quot;tutor,5&lt;OK&gt;&quot;.  To get to statement number 17 in this file, type &quot;jltutor2,17&lt;OK&gt;&quot;.

You might first type in the main topics, then go through and fill in subtopics under the main topics, and finally fill in the paragraphs containing the actual material.  In this way, the document you produced would be guaranteed to be well organized.  On the other hand, if you are trying to read a structured document produced by someone else, it will be possible to view an outline consisting of only the highest level statements (using a new viewspec).  When you read through this outline and find the topic you are most interested in, you can jump to it and display everything down to two levels.  In this way, you can see all the subtopics.  This scheme can be continued until you arrive at the text you are really interested in reading."/>

Jot these down for future reference.  When you begin, you see all levels.  In the upper right corner of your screen is a set of letters that indicate a few of the viewspecs in force.  Viewspecs like &quot;y&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are not mentioned, because you can see for yourself whether blank lines or statement numbers are on or off.  The two ALL's you see indicate numbers of lines and levels visible.  The one on the left is the number of levels, and you are currently viewing all of them.  When you finish reading this paragraph, jump to NORTH AMERICA, below, and set viewspec &quot;d&quot;.  Notice that the viewspec window in the upper right corner of the screen indicates that only the first-level statements are visible.  Then use the Set Viewspecs command a few times, and set &quot;b&quot; (for one more level) each time.  Notice that your view changes, and the number of visible levels indicated in the viewspec window changes to match it.  When you are done, set viewspec &quot;c&quot; (or Reset Viewspecs).  Go ahead and do this now. "/>

If you go to a large document with viewspec &quot;d&quot;, you will see only the chapter titles -- sort of like looking at a table of contents.  When you spot the chapter you are interested in, you can jump to that (by using the Jump (to) MARK command), and set viewspec &quot;b&quot; as you go.

Clipping this down to one or two lines also helps you to get a quick overview of the contents of a file; generally, in a well written paragraph, the first line or two should give a good idea of the rest of the contents.  As with level clipping, line clipping is controlled by viewspecs, and the pattern is exactly the same:  viewspecs a, b, c, and d represented one less, one more, all, and one level, respectively; viewspecs q, r, s, and t represent one less, one more, all, and one line of each statement being shown."/>

Jump to the next statement (with statement numbers on), and try the following viewspec combinations using the Set Viewspecs command (you can set more than one at a time):  dt, ds, ct, dbt, dbtr.
